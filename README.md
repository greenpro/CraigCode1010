# CraigCode1010

This is my personal website.

## Files
### build.sh
* This script runs the smash.py program and moves the folder to the windows downloads folder for testing.
* This script is necessary as I am developing on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows and it allows ubuntu to read and write to windows but not the other way around so the dev folder cannot be accessed from a browser.

### CNAME
* This file tells github which URL to link to for the custom URL.

### craigCode.css 
* The styling for the site.

### craigCode.js
* The javascript for the site.

### gitPush.sh
* Used to push the project to GitHub.

### icon.png
* The favicon for the site.

### index.html
* The main page for the site.
* This file is auto-generated by smash.py any changes to this file may be overwritten the next time build.sh is run.

### README.md
* This file.

### smash.py
* This script will smash the content and template files together to form the index.html file.
* The {{TAG}} tags where TAG is the name will be replaced using this script.

## Folders
### content
* Holds all of the content for the parts of the site.
* As this folder is just content of the site layed out in the same format as the site there will not be documentation in it

### sac
* Holds all of the resources for the SAC project section.
* As this folder is a resource folder there will not be documentation in it.

### templates
