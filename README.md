# CraigCode1010

This is my personal website.

## Files
### CNAME
* This file tells github which URL to link to for the custom URL.

### copy.sh
* This script is used to copy the files into a folder on windows to be tested before uploading.
* This script is necessary as I am developing on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows and it allows ubuntu to read and write to windows but not the other way around so the dev folder cannot be accessed from a browser.

### craigCode.css 
* The styling for the site.

### craigCode.js
* The javascript for the site.

### gitPush.sh
* Used to push the project to GitHub.

### icon.png
* The favicon for the site.

### index.html
* The main page for the site.

### README.md
* This file.

## Folders
### SAC
* Holds all of the resources for the SAC project section.
* As this folder is a resource folder there will not be documentation in it.
