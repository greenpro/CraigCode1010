    Hi, I am a software and hardware developer in the Embedded Systems area. I try 
    to make projects which interrest me, and that are hopefully useful for others.
    All of my projects are intended to be open-source and freely available to 
    anyone. The only thing I ask is that you give credit where credit is due.
