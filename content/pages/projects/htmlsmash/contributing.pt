<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project has been designed for and tested on my web site.
    If you would like to use htmlSmash on other projects and find it needs some adjusting
    to suit your use case, modify the project to search your needs (as well as the original
    use case) and contribute your changes back. This project is meant to be as flexible and
    simple as possible without being complex (as it is a simple application).
