<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few known issues with the project currently,
    most of which stem from the fact that the project has not been implemented on
    real hardware yet.

    <br />

    <h3>
        Feedback from Services
    </h3>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service drivers are not giving feedback from the 
    robot and leaves default values. This feature has worked in tests on other 
    systems

    <br />

    <h3>
        Stepper Motor Equations
    </h3>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the system has not been used with the real robot
    the angle to step conversion for each motor has not been verified yet, and is
    likely not correct.

    <br />

    <h3>
        Simulation Object Physics
    </h3>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gazebo simulor does not currently work with scene
    objects very well. Sometimes the objects do not fall completely, and sometimes
    they fall to far into the other objects rather than resting on top. This is 
    most likely a Gazebo issue as it is random and will sometimes correct itself
    after an object is picked up or moved. The glytch causes an issue with the
    gripper as sometimes it cannot reach the object to be picked up, and sometimes
    it will pick up the object below the target object. The unreliable grip issue
    may possibly be solved by using the MoveIt! package, though this will not solve 
    the sinking/dropping issue.

    <h3>
        Simulator Crashing
    </h3>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gazebo simulator currently crashes about 90% - 95% of
    time when running on a VM. I think this is an issue with Gazebo, not anything with
    my project and this may be resolved with new versions of Gazebo.
