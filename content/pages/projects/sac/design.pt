            The packages in the SAC workspace should be decoupled as much as 
            possible (they should not depend on another package to build), with 
            exception to the sac_launch, which depends on everything, and the 
            sac_msgs, which everything depends on, these packages were created to 
            make the others more independant of eachother. The other package 
            dependancy is from the gazebo package to the description package and 
            this should be removed later by combinding these two packages.
        </li>

        <li>
            In keeping with the ROS methodology each node should do one task and 
            nothing else, if another task is needed another node should be used for 
            it.
        </li>

        <li>
            The README.md files in each folder should contain all the information 
            for that folder needed by a developer.
        </li>

        <li>
            This workspace is ment to be used in overall robotics control education. 
            In keeping with this the installation and use of the workspace should 
            require as little knowlege of ROS and the nuts and bolts of the 
            framework and system as possible to allow for a maximum amount of time 
            spent working on algorithms and concepts.
        </li>

        <li>
            This workspace should include only currently develped ROS components. 
            This will allow the package to keep current with new releases of ROS on 
            current versions of Ubuntu and Raspian.
        </li>

        <li>
            Any code or examples of code used should be noted in the README.md in 
            the description for the file the code was used in.
        </li>

        <li>
            All README.md files should follow the same format as shown in the 
            README_mainTemplate.md and README_subFolderTemplate.md. Each section of 
            the template should be included only if it is applicable to the package 
            or folder. This is to make the package more uniform and to simplify 
            documentation.
        </li>

        <li>
            General launch senarios should be launched from the sac_launch package. 
            The launch files in this package should only have includes for launch 
            files in other packages. The other packages' launch files should only 
            include launch files from the immediate package.
        </li>
