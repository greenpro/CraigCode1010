<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several ways to install the SAC system. The
    first is to install the latest version. This is the version currently in
    active development on GitHub. This version should be stable for the most part
    but may have new features which are incomplete. The second way to install is to 
    choose and install a specific version from the archive. The third option is to 
    upgrade or downgrade to a specific version. This will uninstall the components 
    of the latest version and install the necessary new components. The instructions
    for these can be found in the menu on the left, on the page of the version to be
    installed.
