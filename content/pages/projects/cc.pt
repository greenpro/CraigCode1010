    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is the awsome website you see before you 
    now. This site has been created completely from scratch using simple 
    javascript, css3, HTML5, and some fonts from Google. This allows the site to be 
    developed using any editor (I am using vim), and The site can be served from 
    any type of server, including a Python server.

    <!--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though this site should be awsome enough to amaze. It 
    is not the end. This site is also a facade for a Raspberry Pi cluster which 
    uses ROS for communication in the cluster. When this is completed to a 
    reasonable state the packages for will be posted to my GitHub page.-->
