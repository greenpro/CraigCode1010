<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is the awsome website you see before you 
    now. This site has been created completely from scratch using simple 
    javascript, css3, HTML5, and some fonts from Google. This allows the site to be 
    developed using any editor (I am using vim), and The site can be served from 
    any type of server, including a Python server. Though this project is claimed 
    under a GNU v3.0 Licence, I do ask that anyone who makes a copy of it changes 
    the banners, content, and name on the site.
