    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This platform is intended to be used in education. The 
    project currently controls a simulation of the SCORBOT-ER III robot. The system 
    is built on the Robot Operating System (ROS) platform. Information on ROS can be 
    found <a href="http://www.ros.org">here</a>. The system can be found on GitHub 
    with the root found <a href="https://github.com/greenpro/sac_setup">here</a>. 
    The system runs on Ubuntu 16.04. The system will run on a VM, but it is not 
    ideal for the simulation of the robot. All citations and references for this 
    section can be found on the paper in the downloads page.
