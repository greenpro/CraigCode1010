<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is an offshoot of my CraigCode1010.com project, 
    which can be found at project site. This project is used to compile the site to a 
    static HTML site. The project allows for multiple teplates and HTML parts to be 
    compiled into a single static HTML page which can be easily served up from a small 
    embedded server or quickly from a larger server with minimal load on the system. 
    This project has been designed and tested on linux through Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, 
    though it should work on any OS as it is written in python. The project currently 
    uses python 3.6 which comes pre-installed on most linux distros.
