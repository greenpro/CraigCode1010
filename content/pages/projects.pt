<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These projects have been primarily built by me and are 
    currently being maintained. The projects are hosted on my 
    <a href="https://github.com/greenpro">GitHub</a> and are available for download 
    either there or on their GitHub pages. All projects are free for anyone to use and 
    modify, the only thing I ask is that propper attribution is provided to my 
    projects and any third party components used.
